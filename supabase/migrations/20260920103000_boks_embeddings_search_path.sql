-- `public, extensions`, not `public`: pgvector's `avg(vector)` aggregate and
-- its `<=>` operator live in the extensions schema, and a function that
-- cannot see them fails at runtime with "function avg(extensions.vector)
-- does not exist" - which takes the whole feed down, not just the semantic
-- part of it. Found by calling the function straight after the migration.
